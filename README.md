# PolCommProject
This is a group project meant to test the types of agendas pushed by Senators of different political leanings. 
We want to ask
1. what is the effect of partisanship on the type of issues tweetets about
2. does reelections status affect the type of issues tweeted about
3. is there any jump in issue setting during a specific point in the timeline during collection
